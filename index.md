# Welcome to Bogazici University Virtual Reality Laboratory

BUVIAR is a research laboratory founded with the “Multidisciplinary Project Support” funding scheme provided by the Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit (BAP) of Boğaziçi University. It was founded within a joint project by three researchers: Dr. Engin Ader from the Dept. of Mathematics and Science Education (PI), Dr. İnci Ayhan from the Dept. of Psychology, and Dr. Emre Uğur from the Dept. of Computer Engineering.

Together with graduate and undergraduate students from different fields, ongoing research at BUViaR Lab investigates self-regulated learning and body perception by using multimodal data from the Immersive Virtual Reality environment.
