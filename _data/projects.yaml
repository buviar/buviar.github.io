  description: Affordances describe the possible actions that an agent can perform on an object, enabled by the agent’s morphology as well as the object’s structure, such as grasping a pan handle with one’s fingers. This project investigates how affordance perception may affect perceived interval durations during motor action, contributing to the nascent research linking affordances to the interval timing. Virtual reality makes research on affordances and time perception possible in ways not feasible in real life, such as being able to alter the bodily morphology of the user in order to change the action possibilities (i.e. affordances) that can be performed on target objects (e.g. a pan with handle). In this study, we utilize two avatar hand types: normal and pill-shaped (fingerless). We are investigating whether the perceived time passed during motor action (reaching for a pan) differs depending on the hand type (normal, allowing for pan-handle grasping affordance; capsule, no grasping ability afforded) in our participants.
